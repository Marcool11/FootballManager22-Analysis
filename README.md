# FootballManager22-Analysis
Using python to analyze player's stats and attributes.

Although Football Manager 2022 includes many features of data analysis in data hub, but I use python to create other kinds of analysis.

First of all, put two fmf files (stats and attributes) in the /Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2022/views folder. If no such folder, you can create one.
Then, input the views in the game and print out the data and choose Web Page option, save it to your computer.
Next, just look up every instructions I put in the analysis files to know how to let it works for your data.

Thank you.
